# ASCII Art Tool

#### A Personal Project

## Introduction
**Awareness**
While I am no artist, I do appreciate the work that goes into making art. 
I've seen lots of ASCII art around the internet, from ASCII [mona lisa]("https://pin.it/3yJlvHF" ascii mona lisa pinterest) to [memes]("https://imgflip.com/gif/1potkk" ascii doge gif). It has always been something I was aware of in the back of my mind.  
**The Video**
After watching a video recently of making live [ASCII Video]("https://youtu.be/55iwMYv8tGI" ASCII Video (Coding Challenge 166) - The Coding Train) I felt I had to start somewhere.

**My Assets**
For myself, I wanted to *ASCII-fy* this picture.
